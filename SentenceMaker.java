		String text = "Thunderbolt shaped scar is craved into his forehead, revealing his past. The unique cicatrix exposes his tragic murder of his exclusive parents by the Dark Lord, initiating his equally tragic life with his last living unfriendly relatives, the Dursleys. After going through much misery, he finds out on his eleventh birth day that he is wizard-worldly famous for being the only survivor of the Dark Lord’s murderous attempt, and most importantly, he is a wizard himself. He, as you have unraveled, is Harry Potter. Harry potter is my ideal character as a person. I do not look up to him as a role model because of his magical powers, but because of his will in finding who he is as Harry Potter. In the novel, as well as the movie, it clearly portrays how Harry continues on his life in pursuit for the answer to who he is as a wizard. Similar to Harry Potter, Nora, a character from “the Doll’s House,” is another character that had a sudden revelation and decided to leave her family and set out to search for who she is, not how her husband made her. I, on the other hand, had never given a thought about searching for my identity until now. After thorough thinking, I believe that my life is something that I should savor, and elements that determine the taste of my life, are the answer to who I am. If I am to exemplify myself as a typical example such as a hamburger, my culture is the ingredients, my spirituality is the salad, and my personality is the meat, and these factors determine the taste of the hamburger.  My culture is the origin for my spirituality and personality. It is the ingredients of Wataru-Hamburger. I was born in Japan. And I moved to San Diego, California when I was three years old. Before fully experiencing childhood in San Diego, I moved back to Tokyo in a year. Just as I was about to turn eight year old, my family decided to move back to San Diego again. By this time, Japanese culture became a part of me. Adjusting to the American standard of living was hard. As I bowed to express appreciation, Americans would not recognize the foreign body language and look at me with blank faces, not knowing how to react. Or when I sat in a position called “Taiiku-zuwari”, which is a formal way to sit in Japanese schools, on the floor, the teacher warned me about how I was being selfish by taking space on the floor from others. When I finished fourth grade, I came back to Japan for the final time. I went to a Japanese public school. Thinking that extroversive relationships were the mode for Japan also, I did not hesitate to interact with other classmates. I realized very soon that they were unfamiliar with a person like me, who is “too friendly,” and that I was avoided. Americans tend to be open and interactive; whereas the Japanese tends to stay introversive. My parents realized after several incidents that Japanese public schools did not suit me well. A year later, I transferred to an international school, Christian Academy in Japan. CAJ was very different from any other schools I have been to. There are mixes of diverse ethnicities and cultures. Quite recently, I was invited over to a friend’s birthday party, where everyone else was American. At the party, songs were shuffled and played continuously. Whenever a song everybody loved was on, everyone stopped everything they were doing, talking, drinking, eating, and danced like crazy. I was astonished at their sudden change of character. In Japanese parties, everything is calm and people just talk and enjoy the food. After experiencing two very distinct environment and cultures, it turned out to be that Japanese cultural influence was greater than American cultural influence. " +     "Culture is an important aspect of my identity. Compared to my cultural importance, my spirituality is like an additional piece of information. My religious values are equivalent to how much an eight year old would value salad in a hamburger. I confess that I do not value religion. I think culture is greatly involved with my values. I am not a Christian, even though I have been attending Christian Academy in Japan for almost five years now. Being taught about Christianity two or three times a week, or writing essays from a Biblical perspective was not enough to change who I was created by culture. Attending public schools that were unreligious both in Japan and America contributes to my ungodliness. I think the Bible does not depict me very well, for I do not act according to the Bible’s commandments. For instance, I have not kept up with the greatest commandment, and I do not think I can in the future. In Mark 12:30-31, Jesus declares that to love our God and our neighbors is the greatest commandment. I have to confess that I disagree with some things the Bible says. Since I do not wholly agree with what the Bible says, it is difficult for me to follow through on what God commands us to act like. My cultural and religious sides construct my personality. My personality is the most vital part of my identity, and it is like the meat of a hamburger. That being said, the Myers Briggs analysis was a rough estimate of who I am. The analysis was not enough to completely understand my personality. The result of the analysis of my personality was ENTJ. Basically, the analysis said that I am outgoing, intuitive, logical, and planning. The personality analysis did not capture my whole personality, however, many of the explanation fit. It captured a fraction of who I am. I think everything except the planning part is true. I always procrastinate and cram up everything on the day before it is due. There are some things that clarify what kind of personality I have that was not on the analysis. First of all, I am honest and frank; I prioritize honesty over harmony. According to The Values Americans Live By, I am like an American. Americans value directness and openness rather than atmosphere. Unlike the Americans, Japanese value social harmony. Japanese would keep harmony, even if they had to lie. Secondly, my thinking process is based on myself entirely. I put myself in front of others in almost all situations. In other words, I am very selfish. Philippians 2:3 states, “Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. My personality reflects my cultural and religious influences." +     "In one reference, it testifies that God is great and awesome. In addition to that, the Bible defines God as the single god, the only perfect existence, plus, he is generous and forgiving. Hundreds of chapters of the Bible clarify God’s character and who He is. However, is that enough to describe all that God is? Is it possible to summarize who God, the ultimate creator of this world, is in one single book? No, it certainly is not. As well as the Bible, uncountable examples in this world, such as the nature, environment, and people express God. Similar to how the Bible is not enough to absolutely portray God, one definition is not enough to completely describe us. How crucial is it to not know what my ingredients, salad, and meat are? We have to start with understanding ourselves to be able to understand others. Importance of understanding who I am does not lie in completely understanding myself, and looking down on others who do not. It lies in understand who I am first, before, trying to understand others. For who can understand others when he cannot understand himself? In A Doll's House, there was a character called Ms. Linde. Ms. Linde desires to be busy and longs for someone to take care of. When Nora heard that Ms. Linde no longer has to take care of her family, Nora thought that Ms. Linde was delighted. Ms. Linde feels, however, that she is now empty, and there is no meaning in life. Nora could not understand her. However, maybe after realizing that she is only a doll of her husband, Nora could have understood Ms. Linde. For Nora is in the same situation as she is; they both lost their identity, and are searching for who they are. I believe that being confident with my identity is the first step in understanding others, because if I have knowledge of my character, then I have something to compare with when trying to understand others. Therefore, I conclude that knowing who I am is very significant, for it is the first step in understanding our family, colleagues, acquaintances, and even strangers, and making the best of our lives.

		text += "I did not have a favorite food. Food was never something I contemplated deeply about. Everyday, I either heated up food with microwaves or relentlessly gobbled all the delicious food my mother made, ranging from traditional Japanese miso soup to beefsteak, as quickly as I could. To me, food was just calories and nutrients to keep me alive. My view on food was so distorted that I even despised the walk to the nearest convenience store to buy microwavable food when my mother was not around. During my junior year of high school, however, I went on a traditional school trip that drastically altered my perspective on food. I set out as a group of eight students and two instructors into the mountain with backpacks of week’s worth of food, water bottles, and tents. During the trip, students go through stressful situations, which may test their true personality and ability, thus its name, Stress Camp. The school intended to challenge students in many areas to invoke growth and transcendence of the students’ expectations. Everyday, we would walk at least seven hours on a muddy trail. Within my group, all of the girls were not involved in any sports, and therefore lacked fitness. Just 30 minutes into hiking during the first day, girls were already reaching their limits. For one particular girl who was miserably exhausted, I offered to carry her bag, which she gladly accepted.Despite our efforts of walking for three hours, lunch was mundane and inadequate—orange and a rice ball. Since guys and girls shared the same amount of food, it seemed inevitable that the guys would starve. After a disappointing lunch, we were expected to keep walking until sunset, when we would finally settle down to eat dinner, but who knew how long that would be. As we walked along, whenever someone appeared to be exhausted, we all screamed, as an encouragement, “There will be food over this hill!” Of course, this was just a motivating statement that we blindly told ourselves to get through the seemingly never-ending hike.The moment we were dying for finally arrived. Hell was over and we settled down to make dinner. I realized out of stupidity, however, that I had no idea what to make out of the raw food we had brought up. Apparently, these random packages of meat, vegetables, and noodles were to magically turn out to be what was called a beef stroganoff. Guys were clueless. On the contrary, the girls swiftly stepped in and started cutting up vegetables and meat, while we awkwardly stood around asking how we could help. Although the males were the obvious leaders for the important task of climbing the mountain, females proved their superiority in the arguably more important task of cooking. This was when I was relieved that I supported my peers at the time of hiking, hoping that my assistance in the past would make up for my incompetence in cooking. The girls were incredibly impressive and quickly transformed into my personal saviors.Since guys were unhelpful in the actual cooking, we were responsible for the setup of the fire to use for cooking. There was no oil or lighters; all we had was flint steel. We had to start from the very basics, to collect branches and leaves that were thin and dry enough to catch even the smallest spark to get a baby fire going. After a good hour of struggling, the fire was steadily burning just in time for the girls to place their pots they had prepared on the flames.There was contentment among every one when the meal was poured onto our plates. The beef stroganoff they made looked absolutely fabulous. Every one was, however, anxious of the outcome. We were unconsciously preparing words of white lies and comfort in case the food we had made with our greatest effort turned out atrocious. There was several seconds of silence as we carried the food to our mouths. Our eyes enlarged like never before and our worries blew away. My classmates were praising the food with comments such as “this is heaven!” or “this is the best food I have had in a year.” I, too, was astonished by the delicious food prepared with little equipment and time. The stroganoff we cooked with fire, reused coffee cans, and powdered milk was impeccable. Although this was the first time I had eaten stroganoff, it quickly became a favorite. Indeed, this meal was exceptional. The food was the product of our sweat and collaboration, which multiplied the taste beyond belief.There is more to food than how much fat or vitamins it contains. I feel ashamed it took me such a long time to realize that a meal is not just about satiating my appetite. There is excitement and anticipation during preparation and the satisfaction when the food is delicious. The laughter and smiles that I shared while bonding with my teammates were priceless.";
		text += "A gripping story about an orphaned boy learning to survive with his stigma and to become one of the greatest fighters of all time, Naruto is an ongoing popular comic book series released in Weekly Shounen magazine JUMP in Japan beginning in 1999. Having been around for more than a decade now, Naruto has influenced other types of media beginning with anime (TV shows in Japan), movies, radio channel, video games, novels, and even plays. I am a big fan myself and I have enjoyed the fanworks of others. Researching and participating in the fandom of Naruto, I worked to discover what the fans love about Naruto and what they are accomplishing through their fanworks.  I primarily focused on the fandoms in Japan and their reactions to the weekly chapter releases, but I also compared fandoms in other countries as well. Such an extensive study on Naruto was necessary because Naruto is one of the bestselling mangas in Japan and an influential piece of work to other types of media. Underlying Japanese subculture and Internet culture can be analyzed from a different perspective through studying the fandom of “Naruto”. The story of “Naruto” is staged in fictional Japanese villages, which are constantly at war with one another. The characters in “Naruto” are all ninjas, warriors based on Japanese secretive fighters who use special powers. Naruto, an orphaned twelve-year-old boy, is hated and abused by the villagers for reasons unknown to the young boy. (Narutopedia). While Naruto may seem like one of the typical mangas written for kids, the plot is mature and thought-provoking, with much room for adults to enjoy the manga and participate in the fandom. Although at times the conversations and the thinking process of the characters represent that of a young teenager, the story as a whole is riveting, captivating anyone who starts the journey by flipping the first page. My research was very simple and I focused all my attention to online resources. While online research can be limited in certain aspects research (such as physical interaction with the fans or valid survey of fans), there are many benefits of focusing on Internet fandom. Firstly, the research can be done with limited resources and time. Anyone can conduct a research if they had the set of skills if they had a laptop and Internet connection. Secondly, one can survey and compare different forms of the fandom. For example, the researcher can compare online Japanese fandoms and American fandoms, which is what I did for my research. Lastly, many forms of artwork and relevant works can be found using an online search engine. I conducted my research by becoming part of the fandom online. There are numerous sites online where fans can post fanworks of “Naruto” including wallpapers, dojinshi, and predictions and discussions of the storyline. In addition to these, I researched cosplay—another form of fanwork that can reveal the nature of the fandom—and the people involved in it. I followed “tumblr”, “mangahere,” and “inaruto” in order to learn more about the fandoms outside of Japan. I regularly checked for updates of fan sites to stay up-to-date on recent “Naruto” information and learn more about the community. As I mentioned before, Internet-based research enables the researcher to sample a taste of the global fandom and also of a location-specific fandom if needed. There were many aspects that I was careful for during the research. One is the cultural bias I might have for either the Japanese fandom or American fandom. Even though I do not practice it consciously, I, as a Japanese student, have a tendency to favor the Japanese fandom. My research will be subject to some prejudice and expectation for the Japanese fandom. There will be many more things that I will know about the Japanese fandom than the American fandom that has been virtually unexplored by me. Because I am a fan of the series, I can tend to be biased and have preferences and views on “Naruto”, so naturally opinions that are similar to mine might be uplifted as a positive fandom while fans with different opinions are undermined. I tried to minimize any kind of bias and prejudice I might have brought into this research by striving to analyze the fandom subjectively and consciously taking note of my opinions on the matter. Starting with my least controversial findings, artworks that I found on the Internet were mainly focused on Naruto, Sasuke, a childhood friend of Naruto who betrayed his village for selfish reasons, or the Akatsuki, a group of criminal ninjas who strive for “peace” through violent measures. This was the least surprising, to me, since they are the characters that can be considered to leave a great impression on the readers. Artworks found online were very impressive and many of them were highly devoted pieces of artwork. One good example is a youtube video called the “Naruto Shippuden – Dreamers Fight (Naruto Shippuden: Dreamers Fight -- Complete Film).” The fanmade video is authentic and sincere. One can tell from watching the video that the creators of this film are dedicated fans and love “Naruto”: they accurately replicated the comic books and wove in their own interpretations of “Naruto”. The fanvid is an expression of the authors’ fandom and I believe it is their way of encouraging other fans to produce their fanworks as well. Their excellence in their fanwork shows much respect to Naruto and delights all the fans, as shown in the comment section of youtube. The next component I researched was cosplay, fans enacting characters by dressing up as characters. Again, the fans’ dedication to cosplay was simply astounding and the amount of time they put into their appearance as the characters was unimaginable (Naruto Cosplay). One interesting pattern that was very noticeable was that the majority of the cosplayers are female. Although the male fans are dominant on the surface level of online fandoms, cosplay seems to be a female dominant fandom. This is perhaps due to the tendency for girls to like clothes and dressing up. Nevertheless, the cosplayers express their love of “Naruto” through their dedication and perfected impersonation of characters. In addition to their love of the manga, they seem to love the attention that they get from cosplaying: they enjoy being noticed for their love of the manga and the way they look.Whereas cosplay enables fans to make fiction into reality by enacting the characters themselves, dojinshi takes making fantasy a reality even a step further. Dojinshis are self-published mangas usually created by amateur fans of some manga or anime. Once I started exploring the search results for “Naruto dojinshi,” I saw many things that I would not have otherwise seen in my life (Naruto Doujinshi). Dojinshi enables fans to make their favorite characters do what they want. Surprisingly, or unsurprisingly if you have endeavored in the field of dojinshi, there was a great amount of homosexual content. As I soon found out, this did not apply solely to the fandom of Naruto, for there was more in other fandoms. Many of the fans often wish that the two lead male characters in TV shows, manga, anime, or movies to be lovers and be boyfriends. Dojinshi allows fans to express their inner fantasy by creating their own worlds, in which characters do what the fans want, making their fandom dreams come true. Artwork, cosplay, and dojinshi all are expressions of fans’ love of the manga and sometimes their desires as readers and fans. These forms of expressions were nearly consistent and same throughout the globe and there was no significant difference between cultures: everyone had similar ways of showing that they loved “Naruto.” Comparison of fan’s reactions to storylines between cultures, however, was a much different story. I began by analyzing Japanese forums and blog posts about Naruto storyline and how their reactions changed between weekly chapters (Naruto Chapter 627, Naruto 625 Spoilers). Many of the Japanese posts were formal, information, and mostly positive. Discussions that many of the fans posted were pleasant to read. All of the blog posts that I checked were fans expressing their impatience for the next chapter to be released. Forums written in English in mainly American websites were contrary to that of the Japanese (Naruto 626 - Read Naruto Chapter 626 Online, Naruto Chapter 626 Review). Many of the discussions were informal and some of the readers even slandered the author. Often times, people would disagree with one another and start an argument. It was difficult to tell if this is just the tendency of English speakers to pick fights and hate on the mangas that they choose to read or they really hate the manga. Despite this, there were many fans in websites that express their love for the manga and their impatience for the next week’s chapter. Regardless of the cultural differences, there is one thing that readers of both cultures agree: Naruto is awesome and Sasuke is foolish. After the recent plot development, a lot of fans agree on this and they seemed to have reached a consensus. While the Japanese bond through agreement, the English speaking readers seem to bond about the fandom through disagreement.Through this study, I established why the fans participate in their respective fandom and the differences of fandoms between cultures. The findings were, however, based on little scientific evidence or surveys of individual fans. The research was purely based on observation and analysis of various artworks. In order to establish a firm understanding of the fandom, some questions needed to be answered. Some of the questions include: why the cosplayers spend so much time and money on cosplay and the demographics of cosplayers, who draws the artworks (professional or amateur), or why different cultures react to the same story differently. This study established a base for future detailed research on the fandom of Naruto by providing observations and patterns that was noted. Although there is speculation that the series is near its end, “Naruto” is currently an ongoing manga and will definitely capture more people’s attention in the future.";
		text += "“Berkeley DB is a software library that provides fast, flexible, reliable and scalable data management. Berkeley DB provides much of the same functionality that people expect from more conventional systems, such as relational databases, but packages it differently. For example, Berkeley DB provides fast data access, both keyed and sequential, as well as transaction support and recovery from failure. (http://www.aosabook.org/en/bdb.html).” As of 2012, Berkeley Database is the most used database toolkit in the world. Berkeley DB, is written in C and is API compatible with most of the major programming languages. Margo Seltzer was a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, and Keith Bostic was a member of Berkeley's Computer Systems Research Group. At the beginning of the Berkeley DB, Keith was trying to remove AT&T's proprietary software from the Berkeley Software Distribution. “The Berkeley DB project began with the modest goal of replacing the in-memory hsearch hash package and the on-disk dbm/ndbm hash packages with a new and improved hash implementation able to operate both in-memory and on disk, as well as be freely redistributed without a proprietary license  (http://www.aosabook.org/en/bdb.html).” The database had an impressive constant time mapping between the hash value and the page addresses, in addition to handling very large data.   This is the original design that Margo and Keith had planned out and by Berkeley Database 2.0, they removed the process manager. This is DB 2.0.6. You can notice that not much change has occurred, but the developers have added several new features, such as recovery. As for access methods, Btree is the right access method for almost all data sets because it offers locality of reference for keys; however, the hash access method works well in situations where the data is so large that not even the Btree data structure fit into memory. In that special case, it is better to use memory for data than to sacrifice it in indexing it. This was an important trade-off in the early 1990s when memory was much smaller than today’s gigantic chunks of memory. The Berkeley DB access methods provide keyed lookup of and iteration over byte strings. Btree and Hash support variable-length key/value pairs. Recno and Queue support record-number/value pairs. Berkeley DB developers implemented a variety of different data structures in shared memory, and these were hard to debug and susceptible to errors. The shared-memory list package replaced all of those efforts. Berkeley database has a separate function for almost all shared functions to avoid incorrect implementation of the copy functions. Berkeley database developers also made effort to keep separate functions not dependent of each other. Due to this, maintenance and debugging process is made thousand times easier, which is consistent with the dependency inversion principle. I did not notice any design flaws or problems that should be specifically addressed right now. However, as the article mentions, the original architecture layout might have served the Berkeley Database better in hindsight. Berkeley DB has been used for over 25 years now so it would be safe to assume that Berkeley DB does what the users want and solves the problems that the programmers originally intended to solve. All of the subsystems, in fact all Berkeley DB functions, return error codes up the call stack. As a library, Berkeley DB cannot step on the application's name space by declaring global variables, not to mention that forcing errors to return in a single path through the call stack enforces good programmer discipline. Programmers should not have to remember all the global variables and different methods each subsystem has. By splitting the subsystems, Berkeley DB succeeded in making the system coding friendly. Berkeley DB uses write-ahead-logging (WAL) as its transaction process to make recovery after failure possible. WAL is a policy in which any kind of change is recorded on the disk before any kind of change occurs in the actual data. The WAL is useful and makes the software easier to maintain, test, debug and extend, consistent with open closed principle (open for extension but closed for modification). Transactional library is made out of small components responsible of small single processes (single responsibility) rather than tuned into single anticipated use. This is due to three good reasons. First, it forces a more disciplined design and therefore later will save time and resources. Second, closely tied with the first, without strict boundaries inside the code, complex software like the Berkeley Database will eventually degenerate into a unmaintainable blob of poorly designed system. Third, you can never guess all the possible ways in which the users will use the software. Berkeley DB implements single responsibility well in the sense that many of the tasks are split into small bits ran by separate functions. Most of the responsibility chart can be found in the architecture diagram. Berkeley DB is also congruent with the interface segregation principle. One of the Berkeley DB tasks performed in the interface layer is tracking what threads are running inside the Berkeley DB library. This is necessary because some internal Berkeley DB operations may be performed only when no threads are running inside the library. One of the design choices that the Berkeley DB developers made at the beginning was separating thread identifier and the library. As they figured out later on after numerous updates and new functionality, the original paper design might have served them better. I could not find much information on whether the database does implement the Liskov Substitution principle. In order to assess the quality of the database, I will check the FURPS of the database. The Berkeley database is spectacular in terms of functionality. It is capable of adapting to many needs of users and different usage of its usability is good by being consistent of method call and variable names by not using global calls. Berkeley database is very reliable in terms of stability in its performance. Since Berkeley DB uses WAL (explained above), data is written out to the disk before anything is updated, database has good recoverability. In addition to this, the database supports hashing and Btree access methods; therefore, its performance (speed, efficiency, and resource consumption) can be optimized depending on the situation. The developers put in much work to make the database maintainable and compatible to different kinds of usage. This is obvious as the DB supports most of the major programming languages and is used by many other database programs. “Berkeley DB provides a collection of well-proven building-block technologies that can be configured to address any application need from the hand-held device to the datacenter, from a local storage solution to a world-wide distributed one, from kilobytes to petabytes. (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/products/berkeleydb/overview/index.html).”  Berkeley DB is now over twenty-five years old. It was arguably the first general-purpose transactional key/value store and is the grandfather of the NoSQL movement. Berkeley DV continues to be the underlying data base system for thousands of commercial and open source applications.";
		text += "With the recent technological boom, the ethical boundaries are beginning to change. Namely, privacy issues introduced by the Internet and cameras needs to be adjusted. Camera provides accurate recordings of scenes, and Internet provides easy distribution and queries for information. Because of this, a discussion of several ethical dilemmas is necessary. Such examples are when you visit someone’s webpage, you Google someone, you take a photo of someone, you blog about someone, or you post a photo of someone online.  If someone posts content, say a comment or a photo, online, he or she is acknowledging the fact that what he or she posts is accessible all over the world. This in essence removes his or her obligation to find out who received the content online, from a very public place. Therefore, I believe that it is ethical to visit someone’s webpage and it is not necessary to notify the author for visiting.  Similar to the previous situation, I believe that Googling someone is ethical and it is not necessary to notify the subject. You do not need to notify the person, because you are not collecting data, you are receiving data others had already collected. The information is online and public; therefore, you are not invading someone’s privacy by looking up information that is accessible on the Internet.  When you take a photo of someone, I think that is not invading his or her privacy. When in a public space, people are giving others in the same space the right to take pictures or videos of them by being there. Keeping in mind that you should inform people when you collect information (principle number one), I think that the subject has to be informed about their picture being taken. When you blog something true about someone, unless he or she is a public figure, I think that it is completely ethical, but you are required to notify the person about it. This is because you are publicly stating something about another person. I believe that everyone has a right to accept or refute any kind of claim published online about them. Plus, going with principle number five, you have to maintain accuracy in the data that you are providing. You cannot make up something or make assumptions about a person and blog about him or her. If you are slandering the person you are posting about, however, you are being unethical by posting something false about the person.  Similarly to the previous situation, posting a photo of someone else online is completely ethical if the person is notified about it. The information that can be expressed through pictures can also be easily expressed through words. Coming back to principle number five, you have to maintain accuracy in the data you are providing. I believe it is unethical to provide photos that can be misleading or photoshopped for the purpose of deceiving the audience without stating that the picture was edited.  Internet and cameras created new ethical dilemmas, but using principles and moral guidelines the decisions can be simple. If you are collecting information or publishing information, the person has to be notified. You also have to keep in mind that you should only post information that is true and straightforward. In conclusion, one you should not abuse the power of communication whether on the streets or the Internet by providing information that invades privacy or information that is fabricated. People are given positive rights, or claim rights, which impose an obligation on some people to provide certain things for others. Certain things people are obligated to provide are protection and security of others’ needs to survive. For a community and society to succeed, supporting each other is critical.  Therefore, I argue that software that is essential and beneficial to the society to survive in terms of basic needs should be available for free. This includes software such as Internet browser, food related, health related, family related, or job related. By software distribution increasing, overall happiness in the community increases as well because its basic needs are met easier. As the Maslow's hierarchy of needs suggests, we are more likely to be happy and satisfied if our basic needs are met. Utilitarianism is the main example of a consequentialist theory, and its guiding principle, as expressed by John Stuart Mill, is to increase happiness. In this case, Utilitarianism explains that software that is essential for basic needs should be made legal because doing so would increase happiness, therefore making it the right ethical choice. Deontological view also suggests that humans have duty, which includes the obligation to support others in their basic needs according to claim rights. Deontology tells us that distributing such software for free is the ethical decision.  On the other hand, I believe that software that provides entertainment and services that are not necessarily essential for survival are not required to be free of charge. This includes software that enables streaming, downloading movies, games, video chat, or doing cool artsy stuff. Since the software is not required for survival, the creators of the software are not obligated by claim rights to distribute it for free. Since they are not obligated to distribute it for free, charging money for use is an ethically right decision according to Deontology. Charging for the software also complies with the ethical principles of utilitarianism. By charging money, the creators of the software are happy (they gain money and secure their basic needs) and the users (people who are willing to pay the price) are satisfied as well.  In conclusion, I believe that software that provides services that are essential to someone’s survival, such as health related, should be free of charge. Otherwise, software creators that provide entertainment or service not related to survival, such as entertainment, are ethically right to charge money for the use of their software. ";
